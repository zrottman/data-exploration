# Dreidel Simulation Data
It was the fifth night of Channukah, and I was shooting dreidel with the boys, which got me thinking: how long is this game gonna take? Do we have time to finish this--before latkes, before night six, before 2023?

To state the problem more generally: Given a certain number of players and a certain starting bankroll, how many spins is a typical game going to require before only one player remains with all the winnings? So I built [a simulator](https://github.com/zrottman/dreidel-simulator) to generate some data and take an empirical approach to the problem. These notebooks contain the results. Short answer: Dreidel takes too damn long. If you insist on starting a game and seeing it through til the bitter end, well, make sure that your starting bankrolls are very small. Otherwise it'll take a whole lot longer than 8 days until a victor emerges with all the gilt.
